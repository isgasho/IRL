# IRLab

## Introduction

This project is for experimenting some techniques of IR (intermediate representation) language, including parsing, optimization, execution, etc. The organization is quite similar to [LLVM](https://www.llvm.org), but simplified to a great extent. Some of the implementation are ported from [GoCompiler](https://github.com/wzh99/GoCompiler).
